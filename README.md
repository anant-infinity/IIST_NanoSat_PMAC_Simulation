# IIST_NanoSat_PMAC_Simulation
Simulation of Passive Magnetic Attitude Control System for Nano-Satellites. Uses SPG4 orbit propagator, IGRF Model for modelling earth's magnetic field.

Main Features Include: 
1. Computes all distubance torques.
2. Calculates omega vector using Euler's Equations.
3. Calculates power generation by solar panels, using sun vector determined by emperical formulae.
4. Calculates State of charge of the battery as the satellite rotates in orbit.
