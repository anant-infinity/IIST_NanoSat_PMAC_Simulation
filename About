Simulation of a 3U NanoSatellite which utilises the Passive Magnetic Attitude Control System.

The main features of this Repository are:
1. Uses SPG4 orbit propagator to simulate the orbit of the satellite.
2. Uses IGRF model to calculate magnetic field at every point in the orbit.
3. Computes the various disturbances torques, Bar Magnet Torque and hysterisis Rod Torque.
4. Uses Euler's equation to calculate omega of the satellite.
5. Calculates current attitude using quaternions
6. Calculates Power Generation and SOC of the battery, as a function of time in the orbit.
